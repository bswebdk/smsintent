        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        
        SMSIntent is as small app that manages SMS templates which
        may or may not include questions / inqueries. The templates
        can with a simple tap / click be launched as an intent to
        the SMS app.
        
        <p>
        
        <b>Create new template</b><br>
        Click the plus button in the action bar in the top. Templates will
        be created in the group that is currently opened.
        <p>
        
        <b>Edit template</b><br>
        Long-tap the intent you want to edit and select the "Edit"
        item in the menu that appears.
        <p>
         
        <b>Delete template</b><br>
        As with Edit template - just select the Delete item instead.
        
        <h3>Template properties</h3>
        
        <b>Title</b><br>
        Used to identify the template in the list.
        <p>
        
        <b>Address (optional)</b><br>
        Can optionally be used for declaring a recipient for the SMS.
        <p>
        
        <b>Message</b><br>
        This is the message content for the template that may include
        questions that must be filled out prior to sending the SMS.
        <p>
        
        <b>Insert question...</b><br>
        Use this button to intert a question to the message. If you want
        to edit an existing question in the message you must select it
        from &quot;{?&quot; to &quot;}&quot; before you click the button.
        
        <h3>Question properties</h3>
        
        <b>Ask for</b><br>
        The question (or title thereof) that will be prompted.
        <p>
        
        <b>As as ...</b><br>
        The type of data that should be gathered. This can be either
        plain text as a text field, a date as a date picker or a point in
        time as a time picker.
        
        <h3>Groups</h3>
        You can create groups by selecting the "Create group" menu item
        or by tapping the folder icon in the action bar. A group consists
        of a title and a default address that will be suggested to as
        default recipient for all templates created in the group. Groups
        are edited and deleted as templates and when a group is deleted
        all the templates in it are deleted with it. A group cannot contain
        other groups.
        
        <h3>Use a template</h3>
        In order to use a template you must simply tap it in the list. If
        the template has any questions in it a dialog will appear and ask you
        to answer the questions. When the SMS has been constructed it will be
        passed to the SMS app and SMSIntent will automatically close.

        <h3>Import / Export templates</h3>
        SMSIntent has a feature for exporting all templates to a file on an
        external media. External media might be an SD-card or it might be a
        shared location in the handsets internal memory. You can gain access
        to the export feature in the About box through the menu. The export
        button will only be enabled if templates are available and a writable
        storage option is present.
        <p>
        Importing previously exported templates can be done with the Import
        button next to the Export button. The import button will be disabled
        if no previously exported templates exists.
        <p>
        The location for the export file is: <code>$EXP$</code>
